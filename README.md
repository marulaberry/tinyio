TinyIO Controller Board
==========================
The TinyIO Controller Board is a low cost I/O board that can be left in
projects once they are completed.

It exposes 3 INPUT pins, a PWM pin also connected to an on-board LED and 1
OUTPUT pin, connected to a transistor with a snubbing diode.

A 500mA 5V regluator supplies power, with an input range of 6V to 35V. There is
an on-board bridge rectifier, allowing AC input voltage.

This board has been manufactured and is available for purchase.
